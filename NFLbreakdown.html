                <p id="nfl-rules-paragraph">
                    The National Football League (NFL) is played between two teams, each aiming to score points by moving a ball into the opponent’s end zone. Each team has 11 players on the field, and the game is divided into four 15-minute quarters. Teams move the ball by running or passing, and they are given four attempts, called downs, to advance ten yards. If successful, they earn a new set of downs; if not, possession switches to the other team. Points are scored through touchdowns, field goals, extra points, and safeties. The game requires a balance of strategic play-calling, athletic ability, and teamwork. In addition to offense and defense, special teams play a crucial role in kicking and field-position battles. Rules ensure fair play, safety, and competitiveness, with penalties assessed for infractions such as holding, offsides, and unnecessary roughness. Whether you’re new to football or a seasoned fan, understanding these basics makes it easier to enjoy the fast-paced action and deep strategies that define the NFL.

                <h2 id="nfl-draft-header">The NFL Draft and College Football</h2>
                <p id="nfl-draft-paragraph">
                    The NFL Draft is an annual event where professional teams select eligible college football players to add to their rosters. Typically held in April, the draft spans seven rounds and serves as a vital source of new talent for the league. The selection order is based on the previous season's results, with the worst-performing teams picking earlier to help maintain competitive balance across the league. College players, after showcasing their abilities during the NCAA season and special events like the NFL Scouting Combine, enter the draft pool hoping to be chosen. The draft not only represents an opportunity for players to realize lifelong dreams, but also plays a critical role in shaping the future success of franchises. Smart drafting can transform struggling teams into playoff contenders, while poor decisions can set a franchise back for years. The connection between college football and the NFL remains a key pipeline, and every year’s draft brings new stars, surprises, and storylines to watch.
